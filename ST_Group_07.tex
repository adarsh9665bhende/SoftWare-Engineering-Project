\subsection{Performance test plan/report}
\section*{Objective}
The objective of the performance testing is to evaluate the responsiveness, stability, and scalability of the e-commerce website under various load conditions.

\section*{Scope}
The performance testing will focus on the following modules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Search Results List Module
  \item Stats Generation Module
  \item PDF Generation Module
  \item Price Calculation with Admin Taxes Module
\end{itemize}

\section*{Performance Metrics}
The performance metrics to be measured include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Response Time}: Measure the time taken by the system to respond to user requests.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Test Scenarios}
The test scenarios to be executed include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Search Results List Module: Measure response time for various search queries.
  \item Stats Generation Module: Evaluate time taken to generate daily, weekly, and monthly statistics.
  \item PDF Generation Module: Measure PDF generation time for orders of different sizes.
  \item Price Calculation with Admin Taxes Module: Evaluate response time for price calculations with different tax rates.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Load Profile}
The load profile for the performance testing includes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ramp-up: Gradually increase the number of virtual users from 0 to peak load over a specified duration.
  \item Peak Load: Simulate peak user load expected during peak hours or sales events.
  \item Duration: Run tests for a sufficient duration to capture performance metrics and identify any performance degradation over time.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Test Environment}
The performance tests will be conducted in a dedicated test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. Performance testing tools such as Apache JMeter or Gatling will be used to simulate user load and monitor performance metrics.

\section*{Test Execution}
Performance tests will be executed in multiple iterations, varying load conditions and scenarios. System performance metrics will be monitored in real-time during test execution. Test results will be analyzed to identify any performance issues, bottlenecks, or areas for improvement.

\section*{Reporting}
A detailed performance test report will be prepared summarizing test objectives, methodologies, results, and recommendations. The report will include performance metrics, graphs, and analysis of system behavior under different load conditions. Recommendations for optimizing system performance and addressing any identified issues will be provided.
